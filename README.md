# Video Game Sales EDA

## Objective
This project involves performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Video Game Sales dataset. The goal is to identify patterns, trends, and insights related to global game sales across various platforms, genres, and regions between 1980 and 2020.

The dataset contains information on:
- Sales figures (global and regional)
- Platforms and publishers
- Game genres
- Release years

**Source**: [Kaggle - Video Game Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales)

## Key Insights
- Action and Sports genres consistently lead in global sales.
- Global sales peaked around 2008â€“2009, likely due to major game and console launches.
- Platforms such as PS2, X360, and Wii dominated during their respective peak years.
- North America contributes the most to total global sales, followed by Europe and Japan.

## Visualizations
The analysis includes:
- Histograms and boxplots for sales distributions
- Year-wise and genre-wise trend plots
- Publisher-wise sales comparisons
- Correlation heatmap between sales regions and features

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Google Colab for running and sharing the notebook

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository or open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Upload the dataset (`vgsales.csv`) or download it from the Kaggle link above.
3. Run the notebook cells in order to generate the visualizations and insights.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides a snapshot of the video game industry's sales performance over several decades. It highlights the influence of popular platforms, the dominance of certain genres, and the role of regional markets in shaping global trends.
